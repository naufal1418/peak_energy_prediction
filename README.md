# PROJECT TITLE: Peak Energy Prediction
This project is part of our Unit Assesment of CITS5553 (Data Science Capstone Project) at UWA

## AIM AND BACKGROUND

### KEY BENEFITS:

An improved understanding of the factors underlying SWIS grid energy demand and the resulting cost of energy (AUD/kWh)
The ability for key SWIS energy using stakeholders to monitor the current grid demand for energy and the above factors in real time (half hourly intervals) via an intuitive and user friendly dashboard
The ability for SWIS grid energy users to determine the likelihood that any given day will be one of the four peak energy use days

### DELIVERABLES:

A machine learning model which for each day predicts what the peak energy usage will be (based on half hourly intervals)
A intuitive and user friendly dashboard which provides SWIS with a real time visualisation of the SWIS energy demand and a gauge predicting whether any given day will be one of the 4 hottest days of the hot season
A report summarising the findings of the project as well as areas for potential improvement and future events which may change the accuracy of the model
